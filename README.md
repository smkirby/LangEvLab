# Language Evolution in the Lab
Copyright (c) 2019 Simon Kirby

This repository contains supporting material for a course taught in the [Centre for Language Evolution](http://lel.ed.ac.uk/cle) at Edinburgh showing how to use lab experiments to investigate the evolution of language.

The bulk of this course involves replicating and extending [Kirby, Cornish & Smith (2008)](https://www.pnas.org/content/105/31/10681). This repository contains the data from that paper and suggestions for approaches to analyse that data.
